nuBuilder is the world's best open-source, low-code application and report builder.

== Description ==

nuBuilder enables you to make any application that want or need with the least amount of effort and the least amount of learning.

nuBuilder Forte is the 4th version of nuBuilder. A browser-based tool created by nuSoftware for developing web-based database applications.

nuBuilder uses either MySQL or Maria DB databases and gives its users the ability to do database operations like:

* Search
* Create
* Insert
* Read
* Update
* Delete

= Alternative to MS-Access =
nuBuilder provides an ideal replacement/upgrade from MS-Access. It won't get slower and slower as you add more records; un-like MS-Access.

= Easy To Learn For End Users =
nuBuilder uses an Uncluttered Interface which makes it very easy for new users to find there way around.

= Easy To Learn For Developers =
nuBuilder is designed to be as easy as possible to get started with building Forms and Search Screens. With online videos and documentation, you have all the information you need to become a nuBuilder developer.

= Build Business Applications Fast =
nuBuilder makes it affordable to build custom business solutions.

= Web Based =
nuBuilder is fully web based which means you can use it anywhere and end users do not need to install anything.

= Open Source =
nuBuilder is free to download and install on your own web server with zero licence fees.

= Use your existing PHP and MySQL skills =
nuBuilder is built upon industry standard technology stack and does not require you to learn any non-standard languages or templating systems.

= Single File Backup =
nuBuilder stores all forms, reports, company data and PHP/JavaScript code in MySQL. You can backup your entire application within a single database file.

= Alternative to Oracle Application Express =
nuBuilder is a enterprise level application builder but with no limitations on database size or CPU usage.
